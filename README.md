Shopify AI Analytics
**AI-Powered Shopify Dashboard**

This project is an AI-powered e-commerce dashboard that integrates Shopify, Pinecone, and Hugging Face models to provide real-time insights and question-answering for Shopify store data. The dashboard allows you to fetch, index, and query your Shopify product and order data using advanced machine learning models to generate useful insights.

## Features
- **Shopify Data Integration**: Fetches real-time product and sales data from Shopify stores.
- **Pinecone Indexing**: Indexes product and sales data into Pinecone for fast retrieval.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses Hugging Face transformers for question-answering (QA) on indexed data.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines retrieval from Pinecone with natural language understanding to answer user queries.
- **REST API**: Exposes an API for querying data and retrieving AI-generated insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Shopify API**: To access store products and orders.
- **Pinecone**: For vector-based indexing and searching.
- **OpenAI**: For language models and data analysis.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: To leverage models like RoBERTa for question answering.
- **Django REST Framework**: For building the backend API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Django
- Pinecone SDK
- Hugging Face transformers
- Shopify API credentials
- OpenAI API Key

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminakm123/shopify-ai-analytics.git
cd shopify-ai-analytics
```

### 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT="us-west1-gcp"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
SHOPIFY_API_KEY="your_shopify_api_key"
SHOPIFY_PASSWORD="your_shopify_password"
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL="https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin"

### 4. Initialize Pinecone
Ensure Pinecone is initialized and the index is created before running the app:
python
>>> import pinecone
>>> pinecone.init(api_key='your_pinecone_api_key', environment='us-west1-gcp')
>>> index = pinecone.Index("ecommerce_data")

### 5. Run the application
python manage.py runserver

### 6. Test the API
You can now test the API using curl or any HTTP client:
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/get-insights?query=How%20many%20sales%20are%20in%20the%20electronics%20category?"

The response should look like:
```bash
{
  "insights": {
    "answer": "There are 150 sales in the electronics category.",
    "score": 0.95
  }
}
```

### Future Enhancements
- **Data Visualizations**: Add charts and graphs to visualize product and sales insights.
- **Additional NLP Models**: Experiment with other Hugging Face models (like GPT-3 for text generation).
- **Real-Time Data Sync**: Automate syncing Shopify data periodically to keep the index up-to-date.
- **Custom Queries**: Add support for more complex queries like product comparisons or trend analysis.
